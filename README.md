# PluginBase

A simple plugin loader that exposes some values to the plugin, but still keeps the desired values hidden.

Main application should implement IBot.
Plugins should implement IPlugin.


This is compatible with encrypters. 
Tested on main class and interface encryption, leaving plugin unencrypted.
